Tasks
-----

The following Grunt tasks will be created:

* `grunt build` - will clean up, run JSHint, concatenate and minify your JS and CSS, and place the compiled app in the `app/` directory.
* `grunt server` - will run the build task, and start up the development server. On any change, it will re-trigger the build task and reload the page automatically.
* `grunt deploy` - will build the app and deploy it to the server via FTP, providing you have set the FTP settings when the generator was first run.

The following third-party libraries are included:

* jQuery

If you're conversant with Grunt and Bower, you should have no difficulty adding additional libraries if required.
